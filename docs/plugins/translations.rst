Translating plugins
###################

Plugins include their own translations in their ``Translations`` directories organized by locale. Currently, only :xref:`Core translations are supported through Transifex<Translating Mautic>`. See :ref:`components/translator:Translator` for information on writing translations and using the Translator service in your Plugin.

.. note:: All Plugins must include a US English, en_US, translation.

Below is an example Plugin's translations::
