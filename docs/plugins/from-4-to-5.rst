# Plugin upgrade from 4 to 5 step by step

Here is a list of steps that most of the plugins will have to take to upgrade from Mautic 4 to Mautic 5. You should be able to get through each step, make a commit, move to the next one and once you are at finished you have upgraded your plugin.

## 1. Continuous Integration

If you don't have CI configured, this is the time to do it. This is an optional step but it makes sense to do it at the beginning rather than later. Here's how to get it done: https://devdocs.mautic.org/en/5.x/plugins/continuous-integration.html

In your PR add also PHP 8.1 and 8.2. And upgrade the Mautic version from 4.4 to 5.1. One more thing is that Mautic 5 have local.php in config/local.php instead of app/config/local.php so update that as well.

## 2. Autowiring

Mautic 5 comes with autowiring which means developers will get way better developer experience and will be able to get things done faster.

There is a great doc already written on this topic so get that setup and come back: https://devdocs.mautic.org/en/5.x/plugins/autowiring.html

To quickly check that all services are passing you may find this command faster than refreshing the browser window:

`rm -rf var/cache && bin/console`

## 3. config.php - controllers

config.php should be way lighter now when all services are gone after autowiring is configured. There is one more thing to check. The controllers are now defined with a different syntax. Here is an example:

```php
- 'controller' => 'CronfigBundle:Cronfig:index',
+ 'controller' => 'MauticPlugin\CronfigBundle\Controller\CronfigController::indexAction'
```

Symfony 5 is way more explicit. We like that. You don't have to guess what the syntax is. It's basically just standard FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) with the full method name behind the 2 colons. You don't even need to call the controller method `*Action` anymore. Your choice.

## 4. Rendering viewes

As the PHP templating engine was removed from Symfony 5, Mautic had to switch to Twig. And your plugin must follow. Here is a helpful resource on how to migrate the `*.html.php` files to `*.html.twig` files:

https://github.com/mautic/mautic/blob/5.x/UPGRADE-PHP-TO-TWIG-TEMPLATES.md

In the controllers, you'll also have to update the view paths like this:
```php
- $this->renderView('MauticCoreBundle:Notification:flash_messages.html.php');
+ $this->renderView('@MauticCore/Notification/flash_messages.html.twig');
```

This command will save you some time as it validates the Twig syntax:

`bin/console lint:twig plugins/MyBundle`

_Update MyBundle with your bundle name._

## 5. The Integration Class

If you went ahead and deleted all services from config.php with a smile on your face, you may find yourself in a pickle if you are using Mautic's Integration classes and interfaces. The inner workings of the IntegrationsBundle expects that your integration has a service key in a specific format. I bet this will be improved for Mautic 6, but for now add an alias to services.php:

```php
$services->alias('mautic.integration.[MY_INTEGRAION]', \MauticPlugin\[MY_INTEGRAION]Bundle\Integration\[MY_INTEGRAION]Integration::class);
```
_Replace `[MY_INTEGRAION]` with your plugin name._

## 6. Compiler passes

If you plugin uses a compliler pass, you may have to double-check that it works correctly. In many cases you may have to change the service alias with FQCN like so:
```php
-     ->setDecoratedService('mautic.form.type.email', 'mautic.form.type.email.inner');
+     ->setDecoratedService(EmailType::class, 'mautic.form.type.email.inner')
```

## 7. Getting container in tests

This one will be a quick find and replace:
```php
- $handlerStack = self::$container->get('mautic.http.client.mock_handler');
+ $handlerStack = static::getContainer()->get(MockHandler::class);
```
Notice you can also use FQCN instead of string service keys which is more convenient.

## 8. Automated refactoring

Your plugin should be working on Mautic 5 by now. But let's go further as Mautic 5 uses PHP 8+ we can take advantage of the syntax. And Rector will help you to upgrade for you.

Run `bin/rector process plugins/MyBundle` and review the changes.

_Update MyBundle with your bundle name._

## 9. Automated code style

Another great way how to improve your plugin code base quality is to run the CS Fixer: `bin/php-cs-fixer fix plugins/MyBundle`.

_Update MyBundle with your bundle name._

## 10. Static analysis

PHPSTAN is another amazing tool that will find bugs for you. It's better to run it on the whole codebase including core Mautic so it's aware of all classes.

Run `composer phpstan`

If your plugin has way too many PHPSTAN errors than you can handle right now, consider using [PHPSTAN baseline](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/baseline). It allows you to store your tech debt to a file and it will force you to write better code from now on. And you can reduce the baseline by small chunks every month to get to 0.

## Conclusion

This list of steps is compiled by Mautic plugin developers for the Mautic plugin developers. If you find that some common problem isn't addressed here, please add it.
