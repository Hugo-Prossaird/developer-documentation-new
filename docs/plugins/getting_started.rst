Getting started with Plugins
############################

Plugins are Symfony bundles that can extend the capability of Mautic. They can be very simple or complex and have access to leverage nearly all that Symfony offers. Just as a reminder, this covers the basics. If you require more advanced features of Symfony, the :xref:`Symfony 5 documentation` is a valuable resource.

.. note:: Plugins install into the ``plugins/`` directory. Namespace all classes with ``MauticPlugin\[Plugin Folder Name]\``.

.. warning:: Avoid using Symfony's ability to override core classes with hacked versions in a Plugin. Doing so creates compatibility challenges with future upgrades and/or may conflict with another Plugin that's doing the same thing. Rather, build into core the support you need to enable what you are wanting to accomplish with your Plugin then contribute it to the :xref:`project as a PR<Contributing to Mautic>`.
