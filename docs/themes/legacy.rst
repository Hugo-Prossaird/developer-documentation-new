Legacy Builder
##############

.. warning:: The Legacy Builder is still available in Mautic 4 but planned to be deleted in the future. Refer to the :xref:`Builder documentation` for more information.

Slots
*****

Slot definition
===============

Define the slot with a the HTML attribute, ```data-slot="{slot type here}"````. For example, the text slot can be defined even with the demo content.

The div with the attribute, ```data-slot="text"```, makes the text inside the div editable within the inline Froala editor when opening the builder.

.. code-block:: html

    <div data-slot="text">
        <a>@JaneDoe</a> has invited you to join Awesome inc!
    </div>

The slot types currently built:

Image
-----
Inserts a single image into the div. You can click and edit it with options which provides Froala editor.

Button
------
Inserts an HTML button. You can define text, URL as well as padding, size, and position.

Text
----
Inserts a new text slot which you can edit with a HTML editor. This enables the use of media such as images and videos.

Separator
---------
Inserts a horizontal line to separate content.

Slot containers
===============
As previously stated, the User can drag and drop new slots when creating an Email based on a Theme. Therefore, as a Theme developer, you have to define where the User can drop the slots. You can do this with a single HTML attribute ``data-slot-container="1"``.

.. code-block:: html

    <div data-slot-container="1">
        <div data-slot="text">
            <a>@JaneDoe</a> has invited you to join Awesome inc!
        </div>
    </div>

This enables the User to drop the new slots into this container. In the example preceding, there is already one predefined slot which the User can move to another container, remove, or edit.

This capability provides you with lots of creative freedom for designing and developing your own unique Email and Landing Pages. Have a unique design? Share it with the community on the forums. The community would love to see how youâ€™re using Mautic to engage your audience.

Sections
========

Sections are full width parts of the Theme which can enable the User to change the background color in the section wrapper, full monitor width, and in the section content itself. It's possible to move the sections up or down, delete the sections, and even create a new ones with layout of 1,2 or 3 columns.

Section
-------

The section holds and wraps the content. It can be any block HTML element with attribute ``data-section="1"``.

.. note:: Center and add a fixed width consistent with all other sections to the element.

.. code-block:: html

    <div data-section="1">
        <div data-slot-container="1">
            <div data-slot="text">
                <a>@JaneDoe</a> has invited you to join Awesome inc!
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Section wrapper
---------------

Section wrappers must have 100% width of the browser window. You therefore have to split your Theme into several "rows" if you want to enable the Users to change the background of each section. The section wrapper can be any block HTML element with attribute ``data-section-wrapper="1"``.

.. code-block:: html

    <div data-section-wrapper="1">
        <div data-section="1">
          <div data-slot-container="1">
              <div data-slot="text">
                  <a>@JaneDoe</a> has invited you to join Awesome inc!
              </div>
          </div>
        </div>
    </div>
